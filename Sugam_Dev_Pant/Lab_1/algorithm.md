# Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm

## Algorithm Steps

### 1. Input the Starting and Ending Coordinates
   - Get the coordinates of the starting point (x0, y0) and the ending point (x1, y1).

### 2. Calculate the Differences
   - Calculate the differences in the x and y directions:
     - Delta X = x1 - x0
     - Delta Y = y1 - y0

### 3. Determine the Number of Steps
   - The number of steps required is the maximum of the absolute differences:
     - steps = max(|Delta X|, |Delta Y|)

### 4. Calculate the Increment for Each Step
   - Calculate the increments for x and y:
     - x Increment = Delta X / steps
     - y Increment = Delta Y / steps

### 5. Initialize the Starting Point
   - Start at (x0, y0).

### 6. Iterate Through the Number of Steps
   - For each step from 0 to steps:
     - Plot the current point (x, y).
     - Increment x and y:
       - x = x + x Increment
       - y = y + y Increment

### 7. Stop Once All Steps Are Plotted
   - End the iteration after plotting all points, resulting in a line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1).
